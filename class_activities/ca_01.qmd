**Group members:**

**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor on the following activity. I will collect the handout at the end of class, and it will be part of your class participation grade. You will be graded only on effort -- it is ok if you don't finish all the questions, or get them all correct.


## Dengue data

**Dengue fever** is a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting 400 million people a year. In this activity, you will start to investigate the relationship between age and dengue status, from the dataset of 5720 Vietnamese children admitted to hospital with potential dengue fever.

One way to examine the relationship between age and dengue status is with a table:

| Age|  Dengue = 0| Dengue =  1|
|---:|---:|---:|
|   1| 184|  16|
|   2| 419|  42|
|   3| 532|  68|
|   4| 457| 108|
|   5| 487| 122|
|   6| 369| 110|
|   7| 360| 148|
|   8| 289| 161|
|   9| 244| 186|
|  10| 185| 185|
|  11| 165| 148|
|  12| 126| 137|
|  13|  96| 107|
|  14|  68|  97|
|  15|  42|  62|
| **Total**  | 4023 | 1697 |


1. What is the (empirical) probability that a patient in the study has dengue? (I say *empirical* probability here because we are estimating it from the observed data).

2. What is the (empirical) probability that a 5 year old patient has dengue? What about a 10 year old patient?

3. If $\pi$ is the probability of some event, then the *odds* are $\dfrac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$. Calculate the (empirical) odds that a 5 year old patient has dengue.
