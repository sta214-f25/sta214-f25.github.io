### Agenda

.large[
* Introductions
* Beginning logistic regression
* Plan for week 1 and the semester
* Syllabus highlights
]

---

### Motivating example: Dengue fever

.large[
**Dengue fever:** a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting 400 million people a year
]

.center[

]

---

### Motivating example: Dengue data

.large[
**Data:** Data on 5720 Vietnamese children, admitted to the hospital with possible dengue fever. Variables include:

* *Sex*: patient's sex (female or male)
* *Age*: patient's age (in years)
* *WBC*: white blood cell count
* *PLT*: platelet count
* other diagnostic variables...
* *Dengue*: whether the patient has dengue (0 = no, 1 = yes)
]

---

### Warmup activity

.large[
Work on the activity (handout) with a neighbor, then we will discuss as a class.
]

---

### Research questions

.large[
* How well can we predict whether a patient has dengue?
* Which diagnostic measurements are most useful?
* Is there a significant relationship between age and dengue?
]

.large[
.question[
How might you try to address each of these questions?
]
]

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize the response (dengue status)?
]
]

---

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize the response (dengue status)?
]

**Answer:** Bar chart
]

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
dengue <- read.csv("https://sta279-s22.github.io/labs/dengue.csv")

dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Dengue))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Dengue status") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20))
```

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize an explanatory variable like Age?
]
]

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

.large[
.question[
What plot can we use to visualize an explanatory variable like Age?
]

**Answer:** Histogram (or boxplot)
]

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
  labs(x = "Age") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20))
```

---

### Class activity

.large[
In the class activity (handout), you'll start to explore the relationship between age and dengue.

Spend a few minutes to do the following:

* Say hi to the people around you, introduce yourself
* Work in groups on the class activity
* I will collect the handout at the end of class
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability that a patient in the study has dengue?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Dengue} = 1) =$
]

---

### Class activity

.large[
.question[
What is the (empirical) probability that a 5 year old patient has dengue? What about a 10 year old patient?
]
]

.large[
$P(\text{Dengue} = 1 | \text{Age} = 5) =$

$P(\text{Dengue} = 1 | \text{Age} = 10) =$
]


---


## Odds

.large[
.question[
What are the (empirical) odds that a 5 year old patient has dengue?
]
]


---

### Fitting a model: linear regression?

.large[
**Response variable:** $Y_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$

**Explanatory variable:** $Age_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$

.question[
What would a *linear* regression model look like for these variables?
]
]

---

### Fitting a model: initial attempt

.large[
What if we try a linear regression model?

$$Y_i = \text{dengue status of } i\text{th  patient}$$

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age_i + \varepsilon_i \hspace{1cm} \varepsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2)$$
]

.large[
.question[
What are some potential issues with this linear regression model? Discuss with your neighbors for 1--2 minutes, then we will discuss as a class.
]
]

---

### Don't fit linear regression with a binary response

```{r setup, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', message=F, warning=F}
library(patchwork)

p1 <- dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Dengue)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, lwd=1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))

p2 <- dengue %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = WBC, y = Dengue)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, lwd=1.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))

p1 + p2
```

### Next steps

.large[
* We will spend the next few weeks talking in depth about logistic regression
* Download R and RStudio today or tomorrow
    - Instructions on course website
    - Please contact me if you have problems!
* Bring laptop to class
* HW 1 released on the course website
* Course codebook also on the course website
]

---

### Semester plan (tentative)

.large[
* Logistic regression
* Poisson regression + modifications
* Mixed effects
* Parametric bootstrapping (time permitting)

**Course goals:**

* Be able to model data with different types of response variables
* Extend tools from 112 to address violations of the usual linear regression assumptions
* Emphasize sound statistical and data analysis practices
]

---

### Course prerequisites

.large[
Prerequisites:

* STA 112 and MTH 111 (Calculus I)

I expect you to be familiar with:

* EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
* Linear regression with multiple predictors
* Comparing and interpreting models
* Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
* Basic R computing
]

---

### Expectations

.large[
* Complete any assigned reading ahead of class
* Bring laptop each day
* Submit class activities (graded for effort, not completeness or correctness)
* Attend department seminars (more info to follow)
]

---

### Course components

.large[
* Class participation (graded for effort)
* HW assignments (roughly one per week)
* Exams (2 midterms, 1 final)
* Project
]

---

### AI policy

.large[
* I will *never* use AI to grade your work; all feedback you receive will be directly from me and the TA
* Collaboration with other students, and AI assistance, is permitted on homework
    * Assistance does *not* mean uploading the assignment to ChatGPT and copying the answers
    * You must cite collaborators and external resources
* See syllabus for further details
]

---

### For next time

.large[
* Make sure R and RStudio are installed
* Instructions are provided on the course website
* **Reading:** sections 3.3.1 and 6.2 in the textbook
